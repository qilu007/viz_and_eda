## 'group_by' and counting
```{r}
weather_df %>%
  group_by(name, month) %>%
  summarise(n_obs = n())
```


```{r}
weather_df %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(
    n_obs = n(),
    n_unique = n_distinct(date))
```

##still counting
```{r}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
